# UniDuka
An ecommerce website
The model that I need help with is the product model.
I need a query in postSearch middleware that is in the shop controller which is in the controllers folder
I have a search.js file which is in the js folder which is in the public folder that has the frontend logic where by when I submit a word that is being searched I 
get a response from the db and display it in my app
